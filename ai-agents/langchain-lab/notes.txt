Ollama
To run models using Ollama. Install and then srve the model using command like
ollama run mistral
then it can be consumed via python libraries for Ollama


GPT4all
install packages and just point to downloaded model folder

TODO
#1: learn more about langchain and langgraph
#2: update code to fix below warning

c:\labs\ai-agents\langchain-lab\src\langsample.py:52: LangChainDeprecationWarning: LangChain agents will continue to be supported, but it is recommended for new use cases to be built with LangGraph. LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows. For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.
